<p>I am well aware that there are thousands (or maybe even more) repos alerady exist that do the exact same thing I did, and possibly even better. However, as I wanted to challenge myself, and therefore have not copied anyone's source code. If this project bares any resemblance to anyone's work (in terms of code), it is purely coincidental.</p>
